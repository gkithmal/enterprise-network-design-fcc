# Enterprise Network Infrastructure - Financial Credit Corporation

A comprehensive network design project implementing enterprise-grade infrastructure across 4 geographically distributed sites using Cisco technologies.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a secure, scalable network infrastructure for Financial Credit Corporation (FCC), showcasing real-world enterprise networking concepts and best practices.

## Architecture Highlights

- **Multi-Site Topology**: 4 interconnected locations (HQ, Central Office, 2 Branch Offices)
- **Network Segmentation**: Department-based VLAN architecture with 6 VLANs
- **Routing Protocol**: RIP v2 implementation with static route optimization
- **Security**: ACL-based access control restricting WAN access to authorized personnel
- **Services**: Centralized DNS, Web, Email, and DHCP services

## Technical Implementation

### Network Infrastructure
- **26+ Network Devices**: Routers, Layer 3 switches, access switches
- **VLAN Configuration**: Department-based segmentation (IT, HR, Finance, Marketing)
- **IP Addressing**: VLSM implementation with efficient address utilization
- **WAN Connectivity**: Point-to-point links with /30 subnetting

### Key Features
- Inter-VLAN routing for cross-departmental communication
- Spanning Tree Protocol for loop prevention
- Redundant network paths for improved reliability
- Comprehensive testing and validation procedures

## Technologies Used
